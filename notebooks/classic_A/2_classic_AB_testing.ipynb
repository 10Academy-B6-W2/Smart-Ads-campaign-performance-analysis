    "\n",
    " Hypothesis testing is the cornerstone of evidence based decision making. The A/B testing framework is the most used statistical framework for making gradual but important changes in every aspect of todayâ€™s business. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " An A/B test is an experiment where you test two variants, A and B, against each other to evaluate which one performs best in a randomized experiment. The two variants to be tested can be classified as control group, who are shown the current state of of a product or service, and exposed group, who are shown the testing product or service.\n",
    "\n",
    " A/B testing involves randomly selecting users and showing one set the control and the other the treatment. The conversion rates for each group is then monitored to determine which one is better. Randomness in A/B testing is key to isolate the impact of the change made and to reduce the potential impact of confounding variables."
